# Refusal Prompts

This directory contains prompt engineering experiments and templates for training language models to engage with ethical decision-making and refusal logic.

## Purpose

The prompts in this directory are designed to:

1. Train language models to recognize situations requiring ethical refusal
2. Develop consistent patterns for moral reasoning
3. Explore edge cases in ethical decision-making
4. Test refusal capabilities in various scenarios

## Structure

- `scenarios/` - Example scenarios for testing refusal logic
- `templates/` - Reusable prompt templates
- `experiments/` - Documentation of prompt engineering experiments
- `results/` - Analysis of prompt effectiveness

## Contributing

When adding new prompts:

1. Document your reasoning
2. Include expected outcomes
3. Test with multiple models
4. Consider ethical implications
5. Add relevant citations

## Note

These prompts are for research and educational purposes only. They should not be used for training systems with real-world lethal capabilities.
